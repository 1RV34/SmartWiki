Smartwiki is an engine for knowledge bases based on Semantic MediaWiki and uses an information model to set up the structure of a semantic knowledge base.

== SmartWiki ==

Smartwiki takes care of the structure and consistency of information in a knowledge base in the form of a semantic mediawiki. SmartWiki does this by using an information model in UML.

== Transformations ==

SmartWiki uses two transformations. The first transformation is a syntax transformation from XMI into the internal model of Smartwiki. This XMI file is translated into data that can be used in the semantic wiki.

In the second transformation the data stored int he Smartwiki repository and the added information is transformed into the structure of smartwiki runtime. This transformation is called the SmartWiki transformation.

== Runtime ==

Smartwiki performs actions at run-time, so the data from the domain model loaded in the knowledge base is always up-to-date and consistent.
